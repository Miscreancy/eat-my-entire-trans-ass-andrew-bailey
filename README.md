# Tool for submitting data to the Missouri Attorney Generalk Transgender Center Concerns Form

Url: https://ago.mo.gov/file-a-complaint/transgender-center-concerns

If you want to be a helpful citizen and submit some data to Andrew Bailey, install requirements.txt and run fu_andrew.py. It's faster than going to https://ago.mo.gov/file-a-complaint/transgender-center-concerns and submitting manually and this way we can make sure the website really gets some use.

The time.sleep() is set conservatively, but play with it maybe there's no rate limiting.
