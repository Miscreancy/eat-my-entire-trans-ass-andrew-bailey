# Tool for submitting data to the Missouri Attorney Generalk Transgender Center Concerns Form

Url: https://ago.mo.gov/file-a-complaint/transgender-center-concerns

If you want to be a helpful citizen and submit some data to Andrew Bailey, install requirements.txt and run defendTrans.py. It's faster than going to https://ago.mo.gov/file-a-complaint/transgender-center-concerns and submitting manually and this way we can make sure the website really gets some use.

The `time.sleep()` is set conservatively, but play with it maybe there's no rate limiting.
